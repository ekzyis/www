We are a group of students, computer security enthusiasts and [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) players mostly from the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english). If you are interested in hacking with us, write us at [team@kitctf.de](mailto:team@kitctf.de) or come to our weekly meetings. Starting with 09.11.2022 the meetings will take place every Wednesday at 7 pm in the computer science building (50.34), room -120.

The first meetings in each semester will include [introductory talks](/intro) (in German).
