We are a group of students, computer security enthusiasts and [CTF](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) players mostly from the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/english). If you are interested in hacking with us, write us at [team@kitctf.de](mailto:team@kitctf.de) or come to our weekly meetings. We meet every Thursday at 7 pm in the computer science building (50.34), room -120.

Also there will be [introductory talks](/intro) (in German) starting April 28th 2022.
